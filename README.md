# Single-human 6D pose estimation based on fusion of IMU and multi-view images

The context of our framework:
  1. Human upper body model
  Human upper model includes 10 joint-links, which root joint ![1](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\h_0)(hip) is regraded as human base coordinate. The root joint is represented by the rotation matrix ![2](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\R_{h_0}^g) and translation offest vector ![3](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\t_{h_0}^g) , the other joints are represented w.r.t the root joint by the rotation and translation.

  2. Cost function

  3. Optimization
